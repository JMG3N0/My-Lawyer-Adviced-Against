Gonna reply here for stuff regarding canon-stuff and not mod stuff, since you already got the answer from the man himself, and so Stando doesnt stab me in a dark corner in the street



> because other stand users have improved durability and literal magic protecting them ??? dio never oneshot jotaro despite wanting to kill him the whole fight. your points make no sense killer queen must oneshot otherwise its simply not killer queen
> we've clearly already seen that stand users have enhanced durability, so stand user vs stand user will result in both their destructive powers becoming less powerful in comparison to the other, which is why two stands capable of oneshotting with their sheer strength (tw and sp) were able to have a fierce battle

By no means is there a case where Stand users specifically are more durable or have magic protecting them. You could make a argument they are fated to clash with another, but thats all.
Dio never oneshot Jotaro because he was "messing" around, testing his new strength, you have TW losing in a barrage and having his arms broken, only for the next attack SP is incapable of responding to TW's attacks and can't properly protect Jotaro, which resulted in broken bones, which THEN DIO calls it "here comes the killing blow" and claims that Jotaro will die, which then he goes to get the road roller.
Jotaro didnt have higher durability which let him survive, his enemy didnt try to take his life with those blows as he is in ecstasy from his new attained power at first.
If you want to call that anything, it would be Araki not killing the protagonists, since we do see Jotaro annihilating DIO's body whenever he could, be it his skull, his torso, arms, legs, and not only is he a vampire but also a stand user, so following your logic he would be even sturdier, yet TW who is comparable to SP just broke some bones on Jotaro.
Another thing to note, Stand users are the ones that get their teeth kicked in *because* they are the only possible enemies in a power system that revolves around stands, they dont have super human durability because they are stand users, thats just JoJo overall as a series. There is no statement otherwise, and we instead have feats or random ass npc characters getting beaten up to a inhumane degree and surviving, as a gag.

> killer queen should be able to one shot, that's the whole gimmick of the stand

This is in regards to the gimmick, claiming that thats the whole gimmick ignores a lot of the character and why they have that power. The stand exists to represent Kira's desire to stay annonymous, it destroys any and all evidence there is, reason why Kira can't make bombs out of living beings, Hayato's, Shigechi's and the random couple were killed by the charge passing up to them via a object which blows them when triggered, and Koichi almost had the same fate as Kira was gonna turn his uniform into a bomb as he claims he can make any object into a bomb
It would be the same if I claimed that GE whole gimmick is punching people in the face, because thats what it does the most, that how he ends all of his fights. But thats not its gimmick is it ? It would ignore how the stand is designed to show us about the user, simplifying it to a very silly summary.

> sheer heart attack moved at supersonic speeds towards the teacup and flew towards jotaro damn near instantly. the speed is relative to the heat signature 

I will assume you are making assumptions based on your feeling towards watching the anime, since nothing really indicates it would be flying at supersonic speeds to begin with. Koichi and Jotaro are capable of keeping up with it by just looking and they can react against it, that doesnt really hold to it being supersonic since humans wouldnt really be able to keep up, and while Jotaro I would understand if you try to defend that he is a super human, Koichi destroys that argument completely since Echoes Act 2 sucks balls if he was using it as his eyes. And "flew towards Jotaro near a instant" is just a bunch of nothing since again I will assume you are using anime as a comparison since that means nothing as a measure.
If the speed SHA moves is relative to the body temperature, then he decides to speed up whenever he feels like it, it flew "faster" towards the tea cup, slower towards the oven, faster against a Koichi pushing Act 2 beyond his range limit, slower with the sizzle in front of itself (which would be higher than Koichi's temperature) and then slower again towards Koichi desperate after SHA blowed up the store (which his body temperature would be higher than prior). Not saying that I wouldnt get behind the idea that it speeds up and slows down with the temperature, but it is shown to not be the case, you also have Koichi being confronted by Kira and SHA with the choice of stopping only one of them and still keeping Jotaro alive, yet SHA keeps its pace with a walking Kira.
Also, SHA has a C in speed, same as Moody Blues, which would be slower than stands like HG. I dont really need to point out how claiming that they are on the ballpark of supersonic is weird and mostly baseless.

> talking is a free action in JoJo so in reality neither kira or sha were moving

This only holds up on the anime really, the series is a bunch of static panels, where there are movement lines and character actions with text bubbles, to say that talking is a free action in JoJo is to ignore every single anime midia that exists, since this apply to all of them. Talking isnt a free action on a panel as actions still follow, how they decide to animate that is what makes it extremely goofy.



> bro are you dense????????????? no damage is being transferred, sha is fireproof and would simply explode, cd can't do anything besides heal sha back to the user, hg can't do anything since the tendrils would just be snapped, ge life punch only works on a lifeforms not stands

This is partially mod related, my initial comment that SHA would transfer any effect on it to its user **is in the mod**, since mc has effects, HG has a stun string attack, MR can set you on fire etc, by its logic it passes to the user. But in regards to canon, damage *is* transfered, however SHA is too durable to even pass it most of the time, and when it actually did get hurt, which SHA isnt indestructible as it shatters and bleeds from its own wounds (stands do that, SP, TW and Harvest do that too), the user was affected by 3 Freeze and straight up destroyed his own hand. SHA being fireproof is just a assumption to what is shown, he isnt damaged by his own firepower since that would be pretty dumb, thats for sure, but saying fireproof when, in a imaginary scenario, in a universe where there are characters who can hit you with the equivalent of the sun burning you, SHA doesnt have any canonically statement that it is fireproof to everything.

> it oneshots on contact since it has the same property as primary bomb, we see him do this to the shopkeeper

The only similarity SHA has with Primary Bomb is that it destroys all evidence of the thing it blows up (and that it needs air to blow up I suppose). SHA generates sound, affects its surroundings and it *specifically* seeks humans. Primary Bomb only works on objects, is soundless and doesnt affect anything around it, even if it is glued to another object, like a lock in a bag.

> bites the dust only affects one person,the method of killing the other people around the victim is because of the primary bomb
> bites the dust is only the action of resetting the day the explosion is because of primary bomb

No, Primary Bomb and Tertiary Bomb are not the same by a long shot. Bites the Dust **possesses** one standless person, not that it only affects one, since it can blow up multiple people. Primary Bomb also involves Kira creating a bomb and setting it off, or others interacting with the charged object prior, Bites The Dust is automatic and has its own will with its own trigger to blow up, in no way in hell is KQ appearing multiple times at once in the eye of multiple different people blowing them all up, not all at once but little bits at a time, on its own because Hayato wrote Kira or KQ appeared on its accord, is similar to primary bomb, add in, Bites the Dust **doesnt** destroy all the evidence as Rohan left behind a earring. Its method of killing, its trigger and its aftermatch is not similar to Primary Bomb, unless you claim every explosion via bomb is the same method as primary bomb, which it already doesnt work the same or has the same characteristics with SHA and BtD, Secondary and Tertiary Bombs respectively.

> killer queen does not have 2 different types ofexplosions

It does at the very least have 2 different types of explosions, one that is silent and doesnt interact with its surroundings, shown with the primary bomb, and one that is loud and interacts with its surroundings. You could even say that BtD is also a third type considering it doesnt incinerate everything it blows up, consists of multiple explosions, doesnt interact with its surroundings and, this is making assumptions, doesnt need air.

> it never hasn't oneshot somebody who was the bomb when being detonated

This is just a nitpick of mine really because I find it ironic, but Okuyasu, Shigechi, Jotaro and Josuke all survived the bomb on them at least once. They had the bomb on touching them, on them, literally right besides them or in their face, and they survived *once*.

> killer queen is really just disintegration but with explosive force

Now, this is a interesting take, because that is only true to Secondary bomb. Primary bomb desintegrates but has no force to its explosion themselves, you either are it or not to decide if you die. Meanwhile the Tertiary bomb didnt show to leave destruction around its explosion, but is composed of multiple small explosions, but also doesnt desintegrate everything. Which shows how all the bombs and explosions are not the same and have different results.



> this is actually just plain wrong, killer queen is the perfect stand to get away with murder because it destroys all trace of the victim, atomizes them and their soul, and is instant at doing all of these things. one shotting people is simply part of the nature of this stand ability

You just agreed with the message that follows "The gimmick is to destroy evidence my guy, thats the whole memo of the stand, to destroy, not to "one shot people" Which is where the contraposition in design happens between CD and KQ which one creates and fixes and the other breaks and destroys. Which is why Kira recognizes Josuke as the most troublesome one to deal with". Get away with murder is to destroy evidence, I am not sure what you read there which doesnt mean that. And the contraposition in design **is** real, thats not something debatable, it is intentional.



> the only exception for killer queens one shot that leaves no evidence is harvest,simply because it was fast enough to rip kiras button

Funnily enough, we have no confirmation whatsoever if KQ counts Stands as objects to turn bombs, Shigechi is the first stand user he ever saw, and then any other battle against a stand he just threatens to grab them and make them a bomb, but has never done it before. But BtD does leave evidence, and while SHA will desintegrate his target, and is a actual bomb, it will very clearly leave behind traces of a explosion.



> yeah thats because shigechi's will was somehow powerful enough to maintain that single harvest past his death

Not that crazy from the get go, Part 4 has Reimi and Arnold not moving on until Kira gets caught and Kira's dad stand allows him to stay in the living world after dying from cancer purely on his feelings to protect his son. And when Kira threatened Shigechi parents he locked tf in.



>  i think it's common sense a stand users physical body is stronger than the average joe especially with stands living inside their users body and soul take into account that stands can be imbued in the human body aswell

It falls to a response prior, but no statements or feats that prove that stand users are more durable than non-stand users, they are both shown to survive absurd things. We see more often Stand users surviving absurd things purely because the series revolves around stands as powers, reason why you will see more often stand users, you wouldnt exactly want to see normal guy vs silver chariot would you ?
Stands dont "live" inside their users body and soul, they are the manifestation of the user life force, they dont "now" exist and their existance grants a passive benefit just for being. A Stand imbued in the body isnt making the body stronger, is just the stand itself doing the action/attacking, if Jotaro blocked TW kick with his arms on top of SP arms it wouldnt change the outcome bc it isnt his strength + SP strength, is just SP doing all the heavy lifting.



> yeah but stand in or out a stand users body is stronger than a standless humans body

Yet a standless Gyro gets beaten way more than Johnny and still is completely fine



> so we're not taking into account the more lean jojos like josuke giorno jolyene? every jojo after part 3 had a significant debuff in physical attributes

Yea, no, thats simply baseless, did you put them all in a arm wrestling competition to measure it ? You are taking specifically from their primes ? from the last time they appear in the series ? You are taking into account their ages ? Or how shreded they are ? Because using art style as a comparison is not a argument, see the jojonium Joseph and you see that he has a smaller build than part 4 Josuke on that same art style, yet Joseph is 18, while Josuke is 16.
Jotaro is leaner than Weather Report even, and Jotaro here is a grown ass man on his 30s



> i wonder where the blood is located 

I dont know how many times it would need to be told to you, Jason, but using the anime as a reference, be it for statements or to show frames, is inconsistent, censored and ultimately not fully reliable:

Polnaref gets tied up by Ebony Devil and cant even keep up with its movements, a doll possesed stand with D in power **and** speed. And you want to argue that Polnaref there is stronger than a regular person but couldnt break free from the ropes ? Something that very strong people could be able to do so ?  
Donovan, from part 2, literally states that he can sneak up to a bat without alerting it, he vanishes in the desert under a red cloak, balance on the edge of his knife. He even got multiple hits on Joseph Joestar, who he himself already calls out by saying he has good reflexes, on top of Joseph naturally having Hamon around himself, yet he is standless.

Thats just a bunch of nothing really, it isnt Jonathan hamon mastery that is rejecting DIO, it is Jonathan's entire being, his soul, that rejects him, his body has a separate stand bc of him, there is still Jonathan in there, which is what rejects DIO, all his living blood relatives got forcefully awakened stands bc of it as a SOS



> the secrets of the brain are then seen in the body, this is obvious otherwise vampires would just be geniuses

Not really, it is quite literally, in the brain, Baron Zepeli says so, and Kars, the man who created the stone masks, discovered that there is a secret found in the brain and they would be capable of awakening it, but because of their sturdier bodies compared to that of humans it doesnt fully unlocks the secret of their brain, reason why each Pillarmen is not the same, they need something stronger, ergo the quest for the Super Aja, who ends up piercing fully their brains to unlock its secrets.

DIO, whose brain wasnt fully destroyed, his skull was broken/crushed on the side, but heavily damaged, was unable to even stand up, when he tried he instantly fell down again, which surprised even DIO, who is feeling nautious. He is literally crawling to run away and "he was still ok" ?

Thats very wrong and ignores a lot of things that happen inbetween. DIO cant even stand up, and is desperate thinking how to escape, when he tries to cling to a car, Jotaro uses a knife and he loses his grip, when he tries to escape to the sewer, Jotaro is there, which he then beats him up more, and then sends him flying to where Joseph body is. He failed his escape and he didnt he was beaten into Joseph, which was his gamble

No minions, no chimeras, no freezing body, no ripper stinger eye.

I mean Baron Zeppeli and Jonathan literally charged at DIO with hamon infused attacks and weapons and they all still got frozen, yet Joseph wrapped in Hamon stops DIO from touching him ?

If a Stand user, recognizes another stand user, after had fought another another stand user, claims that your injuries are way too severe that he is just a walking dead man, doesnt mean shit because stand users are more durable than regular humans ?

Silver Chariot is faster than it, while it existed, even more without armor, yet the same guy who uses said stand admits that he can't catch up a stand made of light that moves at incredible speed. So part 3 Jotaro isnt ftl, part 4 Jotaro can't be unless you are trying to argue that not using your stand for 10 years = becoming stronger, as you literally becomes worse in stopping time.

Koichi statement that only exist in the anime, in the manga is less extrapolated. But are you saying Koichi knows the full extent of SP abilities when he himself is extremely weaker in comparison to him ? Are you ignoring that SP is the strongest out of all of them and they know he can stop time ? Do you remember that Koichi literally claims that he saw Chilli Pepper show up and move Josuke around ? Are you saying Koichi reaction time is ftl ? Because that is Superhuman
If a character makes a statement about another entity does that make it automatically true then ? Because Kira claims SHA will kill anything it aims for, guaranteed. Yet it couldnt kill Josuke.

> also giorno was literally drenched in mold for like 10 seconds whilst falling which woulda destroyed a normal human

You state he had it for a specific amount of time whereas there is no indication of it being the case, unless you use anime to measure time which isnt consistent and cant be used as evidence for the fact.
You have humans with the mold have it for way longer than Giorno had it, specifically when it first appears, first with the drunk who loses his arm and legs, then his friend who jumps down from the stairs and loses both his legs and while stuck on the ground tries to run away, and his friend who lost the arm and legs points out that he isnt running away. 
Those 2 exist for 2 chapters and 5 pages. Meanwhile Giorno, had the mold all over his body for 1 page, the same page where he falls, as the bullet pierces Ciocollata head and the mold is gone from him. You can clearly see that things happen quickly one after the other in sequence, how did Giorno keep falling "for like 10 seconds" ? Did you not see that Giorno doesnt splat on the ground because he held on the edge of the roof of a building ? 
The same building the Helicopter was stuck to ? There is hardly even 5 meters from the helicopter and the roof of the building, yet Giorno supposedly was falling for 10 seconds ? This is very important when you try to make statements and claim things as facts, but using the anime as your prime example, doesnt hold 
I think you also miss the point that all the other mold affected people either already are corpses, are literally doing actions which will make them even more making more mold, or are driving vehicles or in the middle of the street which would lead to a accident that would kill them.

> you're telling me a normal standless human could survive this

A stand with the destructive power of D, whose literal introduction chapter has the text of "Ferocious but weak" ? Who bit Giorno to hold him in place and then stopped him from breathing ? Which Narancia was able to quickly find it in the sewer and shot it down ? Are you surprised about what ? That he was unable to breath for the equivalent of 2 pages ? Yknow that people who cant breath still can be saved about 5 minutes without air, right ?
Whats the argument here ? You didnt know that people can be saved when they cant breath ? That a weak stand didnt do a deadly wound as he tries to take away the enemy ?
Like, I am not even sure what surprised you, really, after he is out of Giorno's throat and stops holding him, Giorno even opens his eyes and talk after the explosion, and Narancia also says all they need to do is apply first aid.

> or this

The bullet who didnt hit his brain was turned into a beetle and it broke out of his head, which Giorno intended so that, if he was alive, it would kill him (Giorno's literal words), then he proceeds to 7 page muda and ends with Ciocollata dead.
What is the issue here ? That he didnt instantly die even though he didnt live for a minute longer ? Or what ? He himself also boasts how his experiments during childhood helped him know where to put his mold to stop any injury or cut so that he doesnt die.
Baron Zeppeli survived way longer than Ciocollata and all he had was a upper torso and 1 arm.
